espeak "prelude


the earth is almost destroyed by humanity
and a so-called elite has colonized mars,
because a pale person said: that would be an outstanding idea.

After a while people thought: what are we supposed to do on mars?
It is even more uninhabitable and a so-called elite of the elite made their way 
to the next -hopefully really habitable- exoplanet 'Proxima Centrauri B', 
but this was also not very habitable and therefore the elite of the elite 
is now on the to the exoplanet Teegarden b'.

Why? Because the pale A.I. (the same pale guy just transfered to an A.I.) 
meant that it was a great idea.

But: The pale A.I. just liked the name of the planet.
